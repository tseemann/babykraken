# babykraken
Very small Kraken2 database for bundling with pipelines

## Introduction

[Kraken2](https://ccb.jhu.edu/software/kraken2/) is a popular tool
for determing the taxonomic content of FASTQ reads. It is commonly
use with the pre-built
[Minikraken](https://ccb.jhu.edu/software/kraken2/downloads.shtml)
database, but at 5.5 GB this is still too big to bundle with pipelines.
One hurdle for new users of _your_ pipeline is getting a Kraken2 database
set up, so this project is designed to produce a small, but still useful,
database to get started with that can be bundled with your pipeline.

## Installation

Coming soon.
